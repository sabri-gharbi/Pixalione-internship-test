## Deploy

The easiest way to deploy my application is to use Vercel. I have already prepared a link for you: <br/>
[Live Demo](http://course-mangement-system.vercel.app/)

## Available Scripts

to start the project locally: <br/>
clone the respsotry into your device and run the following commands:

#### `npm install`

#### `npm run start`

## Remark

i am using [mockApi](https://mockapi.io/) to performe simple get, post and put requests insted of using constant data <br/>

but unfortunately I can't use mockApi to generate authentication tokens, so I use 2 static tokens generated using the JWT.IO debugger
